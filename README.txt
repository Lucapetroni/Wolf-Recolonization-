Recolonization pattern of Wolves in Northern Apennines, Central Italy: A Bayesian Analysis Using Opportunistic and Systematic Data

from Petroni L., Natucci L., Fazzi P., Lucchesi M., Viviani F., Raffaelli N., Bertola G.A., Borrini M., Speroni G., Massolo A.

#DB.opp.csv and DB.sys.csv
These Comma Separated files contain the detection/non-detection data of wolves used to perform the analyses described in the manuscript

# Covs.opp.csv and Covs.sys.csv
These Comma Separated files contain the covariates used in the modelling procedures

# WH pup responses.csv
This Comma Separated file contains information on pup responses to wolf howling obtained during the study period. We provide data to run the code, but we do not disclose the exact coordinates of the responses, since areas of pup presence are sensible spots. 

# Code-Recolonization pattern of Wolves in Northern Apennines.R
This file contains all the R scripts necessary to perform the modelling described in the paper and to build the figures presented in the results section
